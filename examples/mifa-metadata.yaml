annotations:
  Segmentation masks:
    annotation_overview: Segmentation label of individual cells of Drosophila wing disc curated by experts from a model prediction
    annotation_method: Cellpose (a generalist algorithm for cell segmentation) was used to predict the annotations. Then, using napari,  images were corrected. 
    annotation_confidence_level: Curators had 15 and 20 years of experience working in cancer pathology
    annotation_criteria: Individual cells were labelled in 3D
    annotation_coverage: 100% of the data were annotated
