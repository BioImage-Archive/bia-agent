    description: Drosophila wing disc 3rd instar larvae
specimens: 
  First specimen: 
    sample_preparation: "Late third instar wing imaginal discs were cultured in Shields and Sang M3 media (Sigma) supplemented with 2% FBS (Sigma), 1% pen/strep (Gibco), 3ng/ml ecdysone (Sigma) and 2ng/ml insulin (Sigma). Wing discs were cultured in 35mm fluorodishes (WPI) under 12mm filters (Millicell), as described in https://doi.org/10.1038%2Fs41567-019-0618-1"

      ontology_name: Biological Imaging Methods Ontology (FBbi)
    imaging_instrument: Leica Microsystems Stellaris 8 DIVE (Deep In-Vivo Explorer)
    image_acquisition_parameters: Voxel size 0.0430x0.0430x0.5002 micron^3
  Second acquisition: 
    imaging_method: 
      value: Multi-photon microscopy

    image_acquisition_parameters: Voxel size 0.0430x0.0430x0.2985 micron^3 
annotations:
  Segmentation masks:
    annotation_overview: Segmentation label of individual cells of Drosophila wing disc curated by experts from a model prediction
    annotation_method: Cellpose (a generalist algorithm for cell segmentation) was used to predict the annotations. Then, using napari,  images were corrected. 
    annotation_confidence_level: Curators had 15 and 20 years of experience working in cancer pathology
    annotation_criteria: Individual cells were labelled in 3D
    annotation_coverage: 100% of the data were annotated
